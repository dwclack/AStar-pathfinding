# AStar-pathfinding
AStar by mansasha (c)

Hi, this is c version of A* pathfinding, my way to realize this isn`t the best.
But it can be useful for beginners who wants to see code.
If you want create your own map, open map.txt in VS and change 0 to 1 in relevant nodes.
You also can decomment some lines in Astar.c to see how the alghorithm works.
